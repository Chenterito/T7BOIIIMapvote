# [BOIII](https://boiii.re/): Black ops III Mapvote
Developed by [@DoktorSAS](https://twitter.com/DoktorSAS)

This project is a project that started in March 2020. The script allows players to vote for the next map or/and mode to be played in the next game.

## Support
- **multiplayer** *(Call of Duty: Black Ops III Multiplayer)* `PC`
- TODO: **zombies** *(Call of Duty: Black Ops III Zombies)* `PC`

## Usage
The organization of the page shows where the files are to be placed. 
The entire mp_mapvote/zm_mapvote folders are mods that should be compiled and used as mods.

As for the BOIII project, only the compiled file can be uploaded. Just put the file in the correct path.
In mp_mapvote it should be put in `t7-server/scripts/mp/gametypes/` while for zm_mapvote it should be put in `t7-server/scripts/zm/gametypes/ `
